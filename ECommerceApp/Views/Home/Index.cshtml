                    <br />
                    <p>While our office is still closed, we have found a way to serve you, our dear clients, during these uncertain times. While we are glad you are doing your best to maintain social distancing, many of you are working from home at work stations that were never set up ergonomically or for extended daily use. We have received calls and emails from many of you wanting to schedule an appointment while our office is closed.</p>
                    <p>For some of you, you're missing your regular adjustments. For others, working from home is taking its toll and you are in need of care.</p>
                    <p>We understand these uncertain times can be stressful and that can also increase tension and pain. Please know we are here to help!</p>
                    <p>Beginning April 1st, we will be scheduling house calls.</p>

                    <br />
                    <p>Our home care scheduling and visits will work a little bit differently than when you visit us in our clinic (when we reopen our space). We have disabled our online scheduling tool, as travel time between clients varies and its easier to schedule by phone or email. You will receive a phone call and email to schedule your home visit within 24 hours of purchasing a service.</p>

                    <p>Dr. Smith and/or Kelsey will arrive with a sanitized portable treatment table and wear personal protective equipment while performing your treatment. Following the visit, you will receive a receipt containing all necessary medical billing CPT codes so you may seek reimbursement from your insurance, should you choose to do so. </p>

                    <p>We look forward to serving your needs and keeping your spine healthy!</p>
