# Wellness Chiropractic Vulnerability Report

## Vulnerability 1
### Exposure

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a vulnerability of using HMTL. This is a client-side code injection attack via malicious scripts that are injected into a user's browser.  

XSS would inject code into your site and other users would be victims of whatever malicious code they injected, be it an email, content or a change to your database.

### Repair

HTML encoding is an important part of stopping XSS. When using the ASP.NET Core framework, it automatically includes the encoding of all output sourced from variables in order to prevent XSS. This is largely done thorugh the use of Razor Pages.


## Vulnerability 2
### Exposure

Unauthorized directory traversal is a vulnerability whereby attackers gain unauthorized accesses to restricted directories. With such access, they can gain access to sensitive information stored on web servers and can execute malicious commands outside the root directory or folder.

### Repair

Using a root directory and locking down that root prevents unauthorized access to everything contained in that root. .NET Core uses a wwwroot folder which automatically includes needed security to prevent access to unauthorized users.  


## Vulnerability 3
### Exposure

* Not having a strong password with requirements will make it easier for hackers to get into an account. This will leave the hacker with all of owner's information, and also the ability to change the password to lock the user out. 
* Weak encryption methods and unsecure storage of passwords on computer systems.

### Repair

ASP.Net Core has an amazing built in password hasher which will store it in the database along with the user's details. A hash is a one way function, so given the password you can work out the hash, but given the hash you can't get the original password back.


### Vulnerability 4
### Exposure

SQL injection is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. It generally allows an attacker to view data that they are not normally able to retrieve. 

### Repair

* Use parameterized queries (SqlCommand with SqlParameter) and put user input into parameters.
* Don't build SQL strings out of unchecked user input.
* Don't assume you can build a sanitizing routine that can check user input for every kind of malformedness. Edge cases are easily forgotten. Checking numeric input may be simple enough to get you on the safe side, but for string input just use parameters.
* Check for second-level vulnerabilites - don't build SQL query strings out of SQL table values if these values consist of user input.
* Use stored procedures to encapsulate database operations.
